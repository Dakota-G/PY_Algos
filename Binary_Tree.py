# Given the root node of a binary tree, write a function that prints out the treeâ€™s content with a breadth first traversal without using recursion.
# You have to define the tree yourself.

# The Queue class instantiates itself as an empty list. Because nodes in a binary tree are connected top-down and not laterally, using a queue is a good method for creating
# 'anchors' for traversal to sibling nodes. Enqueue will add an item to the 0 index (head) of the queue, while dequeue uses the pop method to return the last item.

# The fetch_content function will take the root of a binary tree and perform a breadth-first traversal
# It starts by placing the root into the queue and, while the queue has something in it, the function dequeues, 
# prints what was just been dequeued, and then uses it as an anchor to access and add the children to the queue.
# As long as there are children nodes to add to the queue, the while-loop will continue, until reaching the end of the tree.
